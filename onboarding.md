# Onboarding Feature

Currently onboarding has an AI voice component and speech to text but it doesn't take advantage of the natural language processing of LLMs to reduce friction in this step.

## Redesign:

Once a user creates an account they will then begin the onboarding process.

Onboarding flow:

1. The AI and voice water ball will welcome the user and state it's purpose which is to learn more about what goals the user has in health and fitness.

2. the ai will then tell the user it needs to gather some information to best personalize the users calories and macros.

3. on the screen it will show each on of these things:

- age
- gender
- height
- weight
- dietary restrictions or allergies

the user start to speak and as the agent collects each piece of information, the items will turn green with a check mark next to them.

Note: users should, from the beginning, have an option to do this onboarding manually through forms. We have this option today.

Once all the data is collected the ai will then customize a plan leveraging the internet and citing sources as is done today.

Users should also be able to adjust the plan through voice or text
