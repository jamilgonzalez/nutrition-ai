# Feature: Uploading image of meal for analysis and logging

On mobile (primary use case for users), users will click the "+" button on bottom right to log a meal

- Button should only be for taking pictures, remove the speech to text.
- Button should open a menu (similar to how it does now) but the only option is a camera with text that says, "Record Meal".

Once user clicks and takes OR uploads a photo, the user should be navigated a "Record Meal" page where they can add details via chat.

- add chat similar to chatgpt for typing details with the ability to voice-to-text record (similar to iMessage). The voice record should be a button where users can press and hold to speak.

Users should have a button to submit meal for analysis and recording.

- Once they submit, they should return to the home page ("/") and see the updates in the "Today's Nutrition" section with some concise notes on the meal and suggestions for the next meal/snack in case they're behind in some macro.

Users should also see in the Today's Nutrition card the meals they've recorded, re-using the UI implemented for the "Suggested Next Meal".
