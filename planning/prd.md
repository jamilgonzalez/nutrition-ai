# Product Requirements Document: Nutrition AI (v0)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the initial version (v0) of Nutrition AI, a mobile application designed to simplify and personalize nutrient tracking. The core functionality of v0 will focus on providing users with an effortless way to track their daily caloric and macronutrient intake through AI-powered meal analysis, with personalized recommendations to help them meet their dietary goals.

## 2. Vision & Strategy

To create an intelligent and intuitive nutrition assistant that empowers users to achieve their health and wellness goals with minimal effort. The initial strategy is to launch a streamlined MVP (v0) that nails the core experience of tracking and guidance, creating a foundation for future feature expansion.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of v0 is to validate the core value proposition: can we make nutrient tracking significantly easier and more insightful than manual logging?

*   **Objective 1:** Develop a seamless user onboarding process to capture essential body composition and dietary goal information.
*   **Objective 2:** Implement AI-driven meal analysis from a single photo to automatically estimate caloric and macronutrient content.
*   **Objective 3:** Provide a clear, real-time dashboard displaying daily progress against caloric and macro targets.
*   **Objective 4:** Offer intelligent meal suggestions based on the user's remaining daily targets and available ingredients.
*   **Objective 5:** Achieve a high level of user satisfaction and engagement with the core feature set.

## 4. User Personas

*   **The Health-Conscious Professional (Primary):** Busy individuals (25-45) who are knowledgeable about nutrition (e.g., keto, paleo, macro-counting) but lack the time for meticulous manual tracking. They want quick insights and guidance to stay on track with their specific dietary plans.
*   **The Fitness Beginner:** Individuals new to fitness and nutrition who feel overwhelmed by traditional calorie counting apps. They need a simple, encouraging tool to help them learn about their eating habits and make healthier choices.

## 5. Features & Requirements (v0)

### 5.1. User Profile & Onboarding
*   **Description:** First-time users will be guided through a setup process to input their personal data.
*   **User Story:** "As a new user, I want to input my age, weight, height, gender, and activity level so the app can calculate my recommended daily calorie and macronutrient targets."
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Input fields for: Age, Weight (lbs/kg), Height (in/cm), Gender, Activity Level (e.g., Sedentary, Lightly Active, Moderately Active, Very Active).
    *   Ability for the user to select a dietary goal (e.g., Lose Weight, Maintain Weight, Gain Muscle, Keto).
    *   The app will calculate and display the user's estimated Daily Caloric Needs and a corresponding Macronutrient split (Protein, Carbohydrates, Fat).

### 5.2. AI Meal Logging
*   **Description:** Users can log a meal by taking a picture of it. The app's AI will analyze the image to identify food items and estimate nutritional information.
*   **User Story:** "As a user, I want to take a picture of my meal so that the app can automatically tell me the estimated calories, protein, carbs, and fat."
*   **Requirements:**
    *   In-app camera access to capture a photo of a meal.
    *   An LLM-based service will process the image and return a structured data object containing identified food items and their estimated nutritional values (calories, protein, carbs, fat).
    *   **Speech-to-Text Refinement:** After the initial analysis, the user can use their voice to add details or make corrections for better accuracy (e.g., "That was grilled chicken, not fried," or "I used two tablespoons of olive oil"). The LLM will update the nutrition object based on this additional input.

### 5.3. Nutrition Dashboard
*   **Description:** A clean, elegant home screen that displays the user's real-time nutritional status for the day.
*   **User Story:** "As a user, I want to see a simple dashboard that shows how many calories I have left for the day and how my current macro intake compares to my goals, so I can make informed decisions about my next meal."
*   **Requirements:**
    *   A prominent display of "Calories Remaining" for the day.
    *   Visual indicators (e.g., progress bars, rings) for each macronutrient (Protein, Carbs, Fat) showing grams consumed vs. goal.
    *   A log of meals consumed throughout the day.

### 5.4. Smart Meal Suggestions
*   **Description:** The app will recommend what to eat next based on the user's remaining macros and dietary goals.
*   **User Story:** "As a user on a keto diet, if I am low on fat and protein but close to my carb limit, I want the app to suggest a specific meal or snack that fits those needs, so I don't have to figure it out myself."
*   **Requirements:**
    *   A dedicated section or card on the dashboard for "Next Meal Suggestions."
    *   The suggestion engine will analyze the user's remaining calories and macros to propose suitable meals (e.g., "High-Protein Snack," "Low-Carb Dinner").
    *   Suggestions should be generic in v0 (e.g., "Grilled Salmon Salad," "Avocado with eggs") but can be enhanced by pantry context.

### 5.5. Pantry & Grocery Integration (Context-Aware Suggestions)
*   **Description:** An optional feature to provide more personalized meal recommendations by using a list of groceries the user has on hand.
*   **User Story:** "As a user, I want to give the app a list of my recent groceries so that its meal suggestions are based on ingredients I actually have at home."
*   **Requirements:**
    *   **Option 1 (Text Input):** A simple text area where a user can paste a grocery list.
    *   **Option 2 (Image Capture):** The ability to take a picture of a pantry or a grocery receipt. An LLM will parse the image to identify food items.
    *   Meal suggestions will be prioritized based on the intersection of the user's nutritional needs and the items available in their pantry.

## 6. Success Metrics (v0)

*   **Activation Rate:** % of new users who complete onboarding and log their first meal.
*   **Retention:** Day 1, Day 7, and Day 30 retention rates.
*   **Engagement:** Average number of meals logged per user per week.
*   **Feature Adoption:** % of active users who use the meal suggestion and pantry integration features.
*   **Qualitative Feedback:** User survey feedback (e.g., Net Promoter Score - NPS) on the ease of use and accuracy of the AI analysis.

## 7. Out of Scope (Future Versions)

*   Micronutrient tracking (vitamins, minerals).
*   Barcode scanning.
*   Restaurant menu database integration.
*   Water intake tracking.
*   Exercise logging and its impact on caloric needs.
